<h1>DK Groundwater Predictor</h1>

This repository contains material for building a machine learning model that predicts groundwater levels based on climate data.

It includes data extraction, cleaning, feature engineering and model training. Implemented in Databricks using a medallion architecture.

It is currently being developed on Azure and therefore requires additional setup for running on a local environment.
